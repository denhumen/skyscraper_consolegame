Skyscraper is a simple console game made using Python, where the player's character is kidnapped and placed in an unknown building with 25 rooms. The goal is to find and defeat two enemies before they defeat the player. The game includes friend and enemy characters, as well as the ability to add new weapons to the player's inventory.

## Installation

 2. In each room, there is a chance to encounter either an enemy or a friend. If you encounter a friend, they will give you a new weapon to add to your inventory. If you encounter an enemy, you'll need to fight them.

 3. When you encounter an enemy, you'll be prompted to choose a weapon from your inventory to use in the fight. Each weapon has a different strength level, and some weapons are more effective against certain enemies than others.

 4. After each fight, you'll be returned to the main menu and prompted to enter a new room. If you defeat two enemies before they defeat you, you win the game. If you die at the hands of an enemy, the game is over.
